The script "BSMAP.align.1175.sh" represents a template script used for BSMAP alignment within each pool of RRBS data used in this study.
Data were aligned to the mm10 reference genome, in MspI-digested RRBS mode, with 5 mismatches permitted, no gaps, 20-500bp fragment size, and reporting only uniquely mapped reads.
