The script "BSMAP.align.1175.sh" represents a template script used for BSMAP alignment within each pool of RRBS data used in this study.

Alignments were performed in MspI-digested RRBS mode, with 5 mismatches permitted, no gaps, 20-500bp fragment size, and reporting only uniquely mapped reads.

Sequences from wild-type mice were aligned to the mm10 reference genome, while sequences from SNCA transgenic mice were aligned to the mm10 reference with the full length human SNCA sequence appended. All sequences were additionally aligned to the phage lambda genome to assess bisulfite conversion efficiency using phage spike-in DNA.
