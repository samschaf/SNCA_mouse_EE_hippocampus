This folder contains scripts used to analyze results of differential binding analysis for H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac used in this manuscript. Files are named according to the histone modification in question.

Example:

H3K4me1_volcanoes_2_reps.Rmd: Plotting differential binding results from the TGSE vs WTSE and TGEE vs WTEE comparisons, and performing gene ontology enrichments.

H3K4me1_SE_EE_context.Rmd: Enrichment/depletion permutation analysis for gene features differentially bound in each comparison.
