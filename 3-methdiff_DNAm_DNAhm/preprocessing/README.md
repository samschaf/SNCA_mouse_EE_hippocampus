Pre-processing in R of DNAm (oxBS, subfolder "oxbisulfite") and DNAhm (oxBS and BS; subfolder "bisulfite" used to read in and filter BS data, subfolder "hydroxy" used to calculate DNAhm levels from paired oxBS/BS signal) data used in this manuscript.

lambda_bisulfite_check.Rmd: Used to read in methratio files aligned to the phage lambda genome and check for successful bisulfite conversion in each sample (<1% methylation level).
