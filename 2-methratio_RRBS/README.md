This folder contains scripts used for sorting (SAMtools), MAPQ filtering (SAMtools), and methylation ratio calculation (BSMAP) of aligned RRBS data. Each represents a template that was run separately in each pool.

The script "methratio_fixed.py" was written by [Devon Ryan](https://github.com/dpryan79), and is a fix for [incompatibilities between BSMAP and SAMtools](https://www.biostars.org/p/112049/).
