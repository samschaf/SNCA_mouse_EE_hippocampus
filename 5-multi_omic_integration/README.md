This folder contains scripts used to compare the results of differential DNAm, DNAhm, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and expression analysis in this manuscript.

plsda_each_omic.Rmd: Partial least squares discriminant analysis, performed within each 'omic.

WT_TG_venn_122022.R: Creating venn diagrams comparing TGSE vs WTSE and TGEE vs WTEE contrasts, within each 'omic.

WTSE_TGSE_upsetplot_122022.R, WTEE_TGEE_upsetplot_122022.R: Creating upset plots comparing analyses across 'omics, within either the TGSE vs WTSE or TGEE vs WTEE contrast.

H3K4me1_loss_trends.Rmd: Plotting heat maps for genes with differential H3K4me1 and mRNA expression in the TGSE vs WTSE contrast, and plotting tracks for H3K4me1 at the Per1 gene.

Ssbp3_plot.Rmd: Plotting tracks for H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and DNAhm at the Ssbp3 gene.
